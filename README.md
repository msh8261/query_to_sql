# SQL Agent System with Groq & DSPy

This project is a Python-based SQL agent system that uses Groq's LLM (Large Language Model) for natural language processing and database query generation. It integrates with a MySQL database to process user queries, generate corresponding SQL queries, execute them, and handle errors with intelligent debugging.

### Key Features:
- **Groq-based LLM** for generating SQL queries from natural language.
- **SQL execution** with error handling and debugging.
- **Asynchronous execution** for better performance and scalability.
- **Customizable retry logic** for handling query failures.
- **Database connection pooling** for efficient resource management.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.11 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)

Additionally, you will need:

- **Groq API Key**: Sign up on [Groq Console](https://console.groq.com/) and get your API key.
- **MySQL Database**: You will need a running MySQL instance and database access credentials.
- **Python Libraries**: The project uses several third-party libraries, which can be installed via `pip`.

## Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <repository_url>
cd <repository_directory>


### 2. Install Dependencies
Create a virtual environment and install the necessary packages:

- python3 -m venv venv
- source venv/bin/activate  # For Linux/macOS
- venv\Scripts\activate     # For Windows
- pip install -r requirements.txt

### 3. Set Up Environment Variables
Create a .env file in the root of your project and define the following environment variables:

- GROQ_API_KEY=<your_groq_api_key>
- mysql_host=localhost
- mysql_port=3306
- mysql_user=root
- mysql_password=<your_mysql_password>
- mysql_database=chatbot



## Testing:
- Backend: Run the FastAPI server (uvicorn app:app --reload).
- Frontend: Open index.html in your browser. Enter a SQL query and click "Run Query" to see both the table and the chart.


## Here are 10 natural language queries that users can ask to generate SQL queries:
- Who sold the most units?
- Who are the top 3 employees with the highest sales?
- How many units did each employee sell in January 2021?
- What is the total number of units sold for each employee, sorted from highest to lowest?

- "Show me all employees and their departments."
- "List all sales transactions."
- "What is the total sales per department?"
- "Show sales records after January 2021."
- "Which employees have made at least one sale?"
- "Which employees have not made any sales?"
- "How many units did each employee sell in January 2021?"




1️⃣ Schema Awareness & Dynamic Context Injection
Implement retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) using a vector DB (like ChromaDB) to fetch schema details dynamically.
When generating SQL, integrate real-time database metadata (INFORMATION_SCHEMA) to validate table and column existence.

2️⃣ Fine-tune SQL Optimization
Add index usage awareness: Suggest index-friendly filtering (WHERE indexed_column = value).
Optimize for large datasets by auto-suggesting LIMIT, JOIN optimizations, and GROUP BY efficiency.

3️⃣ Handling User Ambiguity
If a user query is vague (e.g., "show me sales"), prompt for clarification: "Do you mean total sales, sales by region, or a specific time range?"

4️⃣ Error Fix Agent – Self-Validation Loop
After generating a fixed SQL query, run a test query (if possible) on a dummy or limited dataset.
If an error persists, loop back into the Error Reasoning Agent for iterative debugging.

design a system that is scalable maintainable with python code, fastapi to generate a sentiment for the user query

## Improves performance
- Model Fine-Tuning: Fine-tune the sentiment analysis model for domain-specific queries.

- Rate Limiting: Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse.

- Deployment: Use Kubernetes for orchestration and scaling.

- Monitoring: Integrate with tools like Prometheus and Grafana for real-time monitoring.
